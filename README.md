<h4><strong>Social Media Crawler</strong></h4>
<p>Apr 2020 &ndash; Present</p>
<p>Etomata is a Selenium driven Java framework designed to mimic human-to-platform media actions<br /><br />Social media platforms are built around the collection of user data. People may choose to privatize the reach of their shared media. How effective is this privatization? The goal of this project is to use a neural technique to create a synthetic sense of relation between media users. This relation can be used to break the privatization barrier and collect data for information synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Micro-transaction Farming Framework</strong></p>
<p>May 2021</p>
<p>Created framework that involves nesting Python scripts in a VPS to accumulate in-game currencies over time. Scripts manage resource allocation such as CPU/RAM taxing, account generation with dictionary for easy book-keeping, anti-afk handling, and more. Application of project may be comparable to crypto-mining with reduced process intensity. Implemented with ethical and education-oriented guidelines.</p>

<h4><strong>Name It! &ndash; An Educational Quiz Interface</strong></h4>
<p>2019</p>
<p>Created highly extensible python software to help students study by building image/text associations. Identified key issues in model holding substantial market share. Algorithm reads large text files, sorts data, and systematically loads entries into data structures accessed by the program.</p>

<h4>Keycode Security System</h4>
<p>April 2021</p>
<p>Designed and assembled a FSM that turns on a motor/LED combo when a correct code is entered, but produces an audible sound (&ldquo;alarm&rdquo;) if an incorrect code is entered.</p>
