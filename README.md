<p class="pv-accomplishment-entity__description t-14">Etomata is a Selenium driven Java framework designed to mimic human-to-platform media actions<br /><br />Social media platforms are built around the collection of user data. People may choose to privatize the reach of their shared media. How effective is this privatization? The goal of this project is to use a neural technique to create a synthetic sense of relation between media users. This relation can be used to break the privatization barrier and collect data for information synthesis.</p>
